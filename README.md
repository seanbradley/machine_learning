# Machine Learning

An example of supervised machine learning to formulate a linear 
regression that models the movement of a large set of continuous data
over time and forecasts the trajectory of that data into the future.

### LINEAR REGRESSION

Linear regression takes an input or explanatory variable, and tests for
a relationship with an output variable. The input variables are usually
arbitrary and assumptive.

For example, if we were using linear regression to model a lemonade stand's business and to make some predictions about its sucess: the input variables 
might be how hot it is outside, or how big the stand's sign was; the ouput 
variable might be the daily revenue or how much lemonade we sold. It
could be useful in testing the assumption that the heat on any given day, 
and the size of the lemonade stand's sign, is what drives our lemonade sales.

In practice, however, linear regression _corroborates_ some variable's 
impact--it speculatively models_causality_...more so than being a surefire 
means of mining hard data and generating a prediction on which you'd want 
to place a bet.

This solution relies on the Python Data Analysis library (pandas, etc.) 
to parse and analyze a _very_ large dataframe of publicly available stock 
values for Google, and forecasts the future value of the stock's closing
price for the next 33 days. 

The data is culled from _ten_years_ of daily stock prices for Google. 
The output for this program is an array of forecasted adjusted closing 
prices, and an accuracy rating of those prices, as well as a graphical
plot of the prices--both past and predicted.

### SUPERVISED LEARNING

We call this "supervised" machine learning, because there's a bit of tinkering
here... We "train" the algorithm to crunch the data, and do so until an 
accuracy rating starts to look acceptable to us.

As mentioned, the input variables leveraged by the linear regression algorithm
are totally arbitrary. In this model, the differences between daily high 
and low values as well as trading volume are _assumed_ to be impactful on 
the closing price...and we test the accuracy of that assumption.

### MEASURING ACCURACY

The metric for quantifying the modelâ€™s "predictive accuracy" is known as 
R-Squared. R-Squared is more a measure of how each of the data points 
(daily prices) conforms to, or how tightly packed around they are to the
averaged trajectory those values. It references, to some degree, the strength 
of the trajectory driving the forecast over a given duration of time.

R-Squared reveals the relationship of a value to time. The more closely 
prices move in a linear relationship with the passing of time, the stronger 
the trend. Put another way, R-squared simply measures the degree to which the movement of the stock's price can be explained by the underlying algorithm
we've created to model that movement.

R-Squared values range from 0 to 1. A score of 1.00 would indicate a perfect correlation, whereas a score of 0.00 indicates no correlation between the 
price and the regression as calculated over the given period of time. 

For example, if the R-Squared value over 30 days is at 0.8, this means  
80% of the price's movement aligns or fits well with the our assumptions. 
The other 20% indicates prices that do not fall into or fit well within 
the model--as algorithmically defined.

R-Squared, more so than a measure of forecast accuracy, is useful as means
to corroborating market trends, or other technical indicators (for instance,
a Regression Slope indicator--which reveals if the market is going up
or down).

### PLOTTING RESULTS

For our model here, you can see the Python interpreter's output: an array 
of daily adusted closing prices for Google going 33 days into the future. 
The R-Squared value for those prices can be seen at the bottom right of 
the array, after the closing bracket ("]") for the prices.

Moreover, this script graph's these forecastedvalues. An example of the 
resultant graph is below:

![Google Stock Prices -- Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanbradley/machine_learning/master/graph.png) 

The graph, in full, not only shows the trajectory of Google's stock for 
a _ten_year_ period, but also the forecasted values. The resultant values 
predicted 33 days into the future are contained in the blue blip at the 
right edge of the above chart. That segment is zoomed in here:

indicators used as the underly input variables for this model, see 
the docstrings and inline commentary in the linear_regression.py script.

### INSTALLATION AND USE

You'll need Python set up on your machine, of course, and you ought to set 
up a virtual environment, as per any proper Python project. Virtualenvwrapper 
is also recommended.

To install, clone this repo into your virtual env and execute the following 
command...

    pip install -R requirements.txt

To run...
    
    python linear_regression.py

### VISUALIZING THE RESULTS

For interactive graphing of the output in the Python interpreter without 
iPython:

In the matplotlibrc file...

1) Set the backend to TkAgg 

2) Set interactive to True

If using a virtual env, you can find the matplotlibrc file in...

    /home/<username>/.virtualenvs/machine_learning/lib/python3.4/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc

Also, you'll need to make sure tkinter is installed...

    sudo apt-get install python3-tk

You may also need to install SIP (sip-4.19.1) and/or PyQt4 (PyQt4_gpl_x11-4.12).
